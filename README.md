To prepare a GitHub repository for the given code snippet, you will need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Log in** to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the **"+" icon** in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3. **Name** your repository something relevant to the code, e.g., `twitter-unfollow-script`.
4. Add a **description** if you like (optional), e.g., "Script to unfollow users on Twitter automatically."
5. Choose whether the repository will be **public or private**.
6. Initialize the repository with a README file, `.gitignore` (selecting the appropriate language, if available), and a license if you wish.
7. Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 2: Add Your Code to the Repository

After creating the repository, you need to add your code:

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository-URL]`.
2. Create a new file in your local repository's directory, e.g., `unfollowScript.js`.
3. **Copy** the provided code snippet into `unfollowScript.js`.
4. Open a terminal in your repository directory.
5. Use `git add .` to **stage** your new file.
6. Commit the change with a message, e.g., `git commit -m "Add unfollow script"`.
7. **Push** the commit to GitHub with `git push origin main`.

### Step 3: Enhance Your Repository

To make your repository more professional and user-friendly, consider adding the following:

- **README.md**: Update this file to explain what the script does, how to use it, and any prerequisites (like having Node.js installed, if applicable).
- **License**: Choose an appropriate license to let others know how they can use your script.
- **Contributing Guide**: If you want others to contribute to your script, add a CONTRIBUTING.md file to explain how they can do so.
- **Issue Templates**: If you're open to bug reports or feature suggestions, set up issue templates.

### Step 4: Publish and Share

Once everything is set up, you can share your repository link with others who might find your script useful. You might also want to look into further GitHub features, like GitHub Actions, if you plan to automate testing or linting for your script.

Remember, the code snippet provided automatically unfollows users on a platform, so it's important to ensure it's used responsibly and ethically, respecting the platform's terms of service.
